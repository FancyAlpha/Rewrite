        <blockquote>“When it comes to managing a small business, the hardest part is keeping up morale.  There are many late nights of hard work and the benefits aren’t often seen until weeks or months later.  But in the end it’s all worth it, especially when more and more users leave positive feedback!”</blockquote>

He currently interns at Lockheed Martin and is planning to attend Caltech or M.I.T.</p>
        <p>“I started this company because I noticed that there really wasn’t any options for writers to get started.  Everything was segmented into it’s own little branch, and there really wasn’t a how to guide or anything special, you just had to jump in and hope you didn’t drown!”</p>
